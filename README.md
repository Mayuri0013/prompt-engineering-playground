# 🎯 Prompt Engineering Playground

A beginner-friendly playground to create, compare, and evaluate AI prompts.

Prompt Engineering Playground helps users understand how changing a prompt can affect an AI-generated response. It allows users to compare responses from original and improved prompts and evaluate prompt quality using a rule-based scoring system.

---

## ✨ Features

### 📝 Prompt Builder
Create improved prompts by specifying:
- Topic
- Target audience
- Preferred explanation style

### 🤖 AI Response Comparison
- Generate responses using the Groq API.
- Compare responses from original and improved prompts.
- View both responses side by side.

### 📊 Prompt Quality Evaluation
- Evaluate prompts based on specificity, clarity, context, and structure.
- Display scores for each criterion.
- Calculate a total score out of 20.
- Compare the quality scores of original and improved prompts.

**Note:** The evaluation system uses rule-based heuristics. The scores are estimates of prompt quality and do not guarantee the quality or accuracy of AI-generated responses.
